      <Content>Journalism only tells us what men are doing; it is fiction that tells us what they are thinking, and still more what they are feeling. If a new scientific theory finds the soul of a man in his dreams, at least it ought not to leave out his day-dreams. And all fiction is only a diary of day-dreams instead of days. And this profound preoccupation of men's minds with certain things always eventually has an effect even on the external expression of the age.</Content>

      <Content>The life of a thinking man will probably be divided into two parts-- the first in which he desires to exterminate modern thinkers, and the second in which he desires to watch them exterminating each other... Suppose, for instance, there is an old story and a new sceptic who is skeptical of the story. We have only to wait a little while for a yet newer skeptic who is skeptical of the skeptic. He will probably find the old notion actually a help in his new notion. This process is an abstract truth applying to anything, apart from agreement or disagreement.</Content>
